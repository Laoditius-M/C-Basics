/* Exercise 9 - BurmaShave
From 1925 through 1963, Burma Shave advertising signs appeared next to
highways all across the United States. There were always four or five signs
in a row containing pieces of a rhyme, followed by a final sign that
read “Burma Shave.” For example, one set of signs that has been preserved
by the Smithsonian Institution reads as follows:
Shaving brushes
You’ll soon see ’em
On a shelf
In some museum
Burma Shave
Find a classic Burma Shave rhyme on the Web and write a program named BurmaShave
that displays the rhyme.
Program Requirement:
- Display the rhyme.
